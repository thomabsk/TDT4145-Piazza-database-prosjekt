This Java program uses SQL to solve the Piazza project given in TDT4145 Database og Datamodellering. The program solves the following 5 use cases:

1. A user logs into the system.
2. A user makes a post belonging to a spesific folder.
3. An instructor replies to a post belonging to a specific folder.
4. A user searches for posts with a specific keyword.
5. An instructor views statistics for users and how many post they have read and how many they have created.

To use this program you need to download the file that contains both the SQL script and the Java Code. When you run the code you'll get a menu for the different use cases. You need to be logged in (use case 1) to execute the four other use cases. To log in, you can use the e-mails and passwords in "testInput.sql". This can for example be **t@s.com**, **thomas123**.
